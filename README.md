# city_timestamps

This is a twitter bot that tweets the current time in random cities across the globe at random intervals. It also responds to properly-formatted mentions and DMs with the current time in the city mentioned. 

Cities come from [Frictionless Data](http://data.okfn.org/data/core/world-cities) and [Michael Mahemoff](https://github.com/mahemoff/geodata).

Timezones come from the [Timezones gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/timezone/versions/1.2.5). 

Latitude and longitude for cities from the Frictionless Data dataset come from [Geonames](https://rubygems.org/gems/timezone/versions/1.2.5).
